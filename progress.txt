Feature: Investigate difference between rhtas-console-ui font sizing and calunga-ui
Files changed:
- Investigated rhtas-console-ui and found it imports both @patternfly/patternfly/patternfly.css and @patternfly/patternfly/patternfly-addons.css in App.tsx
- calunga-ui was only importing @patternfly/patternfly/patternfly.css, missing the patternfly-addons.css
- Updated calunga_ui/client/src/App.tsx to import @patternfly/patternfly/patternfly-addons.css
- Updated calunga_ui/client/src/index.tsx to comment out global.css import (no longer needed with proper PatternFly CSS)
- The missing patternfly-addons.css was the root cause of incorrect font sizing
- calunga-ui now uses PatternFly default font sizing like rhtas-console-ui without requiring custom CSS overrides
Status: Complete

- Updated client/src/pages/python-wheels/python-wheels-context.tsx to add getItemValue functions for all filter categories
- Updated Name filter to use getItemValue: (item) => item.wheel
- Updated Platform filter to use getItemValue: (item) => item.platform and removed "any" option (only x86_64, aarch64)
- Updated Source Index filter to use getItemValue: (item) => item.sourceIndex and removed "PyPI" option (only TDL, AIPCC)
- Removed Classification filter category as it doesn't exist in dummy data

Feature: Nothing is rendered at https://cryptorodeo.github.io/calunga-ui-demo/
Files changed:
- Updated .github/workflows/deploy.yml to fix PUBLIC_PATH from /calunga-ui/ to /calunga-ui-demo/
- The mismatch between repository name (calunga-ui-demo) and PUBLIC_PATH (/calunga-ui/) was causing assets and routes to fail loading
- Router basename and assetPrefix now correctly match the actual GitHub Pages URL path
Status: Complete

Feature: The github page is now deployed, but the masthead does not render properly
Files changed:
- Updated client/src/app/hooks/useBranding.ts to process branding strings at runtime
- Added processBrandingStrings function to replace <%= brandingRoot %> template variables with actual PUBLIC_PATH-based paths
- The function replaces <%= brandingRoot %> with {PUBLIC_PATH}/branding in all branding image sources (leftBrand, rightBrand, about imageSrc)
- Uses useMemo to cache the processed branding strings for performance
- The masthead logo now correctly resolves to /calunga-ui-demo/branding/images/masthead-logo.svg on GitHub Pages
- This fix ensures the masthead logo and other branding assets load correctly in static GitHub Pages deployments
Status: Complete
